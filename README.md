# IST 722- Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence

## FUDGE COMPANIES

### Introduction:

This repository documents my work on a Data Warehouse project, a key component of the IST 722 - Data Warehouse course at Syracuse University. 
The project centers around the hypothetical merger of two companies, **Fudgeflix and Fudgemart**, which are analogous to **Netflix and Amazon** in the real world. 
In light of Fudgemart's acquisition of Fudgeflix, the primary objective was to develop an integrated Data Warehouse for the Fudge Companies. 
This integrated system harmonizes data from both entities and implements two critical business processes.

The technical backbone of the project involved the use of Snowflake for data extraction and loading, and DBT Cloud for data transformation. 
The project's methodology adhered to the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) integration approach, ensuring efficient data processing and management.

The repository is a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts and documentation, detailing the data transformation processes. 
It also includes a Data Loader script, instrumental in the extraction and loading of data into Snowflake. These resources serve as practical 
guides and references for similar data integration tasks. This project was done under the guidance of **Professor Micheal Fudge** at **Syracuse University**, 
providing a comprehensive educational experience in Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence.

### Significant learnings:

- Understanding various database constructs: Operational Data Store (ODS), Data Warehouse, and Data Mart.
- Identifying the components and functionalities of a data warehouse.
- Distinguishing between the methodologies of Ralf Kimball and Bill Inmon in data warehousing.
- Comparing integration techniques: ELT vs ETL.
- Conceptualizing and proposing a Master Data Management (MDM) solution.
- Creating and managing database objects using popular database management systems.
- Designing and implementing the structural and analytical components of data warehousing and business intelligence.

### Concepts Used

ELT, Inmom-Kimball methodologies, Star/Snowflake schema, OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) modeling, BI (Business Intelligence) reporting, SQL Query Optimization, and Dashboarding.
